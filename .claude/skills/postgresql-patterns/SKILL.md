# PostgreSQL Patterns

PostgreSQL-specific optimization patterns. For DB-agnostic patterns (transactions, N+1, caching principles, EXPLAIN ANALYZE, zero-downtime migrations), see database-patterns skill.

## Index Types

### When to Use Which Index

| Type | Best For | Not Suitable For |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| B-tree (default) | Equality and range queries on scalar columns | JSONB, arrays, geometric data |
| GiST | Range overlap queries, geometric/spatial data, full-text on update-heavy tables | Simple equality queries |
| GIN | JSONB (`@>`, `?`, `?|`, `?&`), arrays (`@>`, `<@`, `&&`), full-text on read-heavy tables | Update-heavy tables (rebuild cost) |
| BRIN | Large tables where indexed column correlates with physical row order (timestamps, sequences) | Randomly ordered data |

### Partial Indexes

Index only the rows that matter:

```sql
-- Only index active users (skip 90% of rows)
CREATE INDEX idx_users_active_email ON users (email) WHERE is_active = true;

-- Only index non-null values
CREATE INDEX idx_users_phone ON users (phone) WHERE phone IS NOT NULL;
```

**When to use**: Queries that consistently filter on the same condition. Significant storage savings when the filtered subset is small relative to total rows.

## Data Types

### JSONB

Binary JSON with indexing support. Prefer over JSON (which stores raw text).

**Anti-pattern**: Storing relational data in JSONB to avoid schema changes. Use JSONB for truly semi-structured data (user preferences, API responses, feature flags), not as a substitute for proper columns.

### Enums

Type-safe enumerated values. **Caveat**: Adding values is easy (`ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE`), but removing or renaming values requires a migration. Use enums for stable value sets.

### Range Types with Exclusion Constraints

```sql
CREATE TABLE reservations (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    room_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    during TSTZRANGE NOT NULL,
    EXCLUDE USING gist (room_id WITH =, during WITH &&)
);
-- No overlapping reservations for the same room (enforced at DB level)
```

## Connection Pooling with PgBouncer

### Pooling Mode Selection

| Mode | Use Case | Prepared Statements | Session Features |
|------|----------|--------------------:|-----------------|
| Session | Long-lived connections | Yes | Full |
| Transaction | Serverless, short queries | No | Per-transaction only |
| Statement | Simple read replicas | No | None |

- **Transaction mode** for web applications (connections returned after each transaction)
- **Session mode** when using prepared statements or session-level features (advisory locks, temp tables)
- Avoid `LISTEN/NOTIFY` in transaction mode (requires session mode)

## VACUUM and Autovacuum

PostgreSQL's MVCC creates dead tuples on UPDATE/DELETE. VACUUM reclaims space.

### Autovacuum Tuning for Write-Heavy Tables

```sql
ALTER TABLE high_write_table SET (
    autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.01,    -- Default 0.2 (20%)
    autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.005   -- Default 0.1 (10%)
);
```

**Anti-pattern**: Disabling autovacuum. Even if you run manual VACUUM, autovacuum also triggers ANALYZE for query planner statistics.

## Query Optimization (PostgreSQL-Specific)

### Non-Obvious Techniques

```sql
-- DISTINCT ON for "latest per group" (no equivalent in MySQL)
SELECT DISTINCT ON (user_id) user_id, created_at, content
FROM comments ORDER BY user_id, created_at DESC;
```

### pg_stat_statements

Enable for query performance monitoring:

```sql
SELECT query, calls, total_exec_time, mean_exec_time, rows
FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC LIMIT 20;
```

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Correct index type for the data pattern (B-tree vs GiST vs GIN vs BRIN)
- [ ] JSONB used instead of JSON for indexed/queried data
- [ ] Partial indexes considered for filtered queries
- [ ] Autovacuum tuned for write-heavy tables
- [ ] PgBouncer mode matches application requirements
- [ ] Replication lag accounted for in read-after-write paths
