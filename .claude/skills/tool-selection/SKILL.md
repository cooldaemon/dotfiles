# Tool Selection Policy

## CLI-First Principle

Prefer CLI tools over MCP servers when a CLI equivalent exists. CLI tools are more token-efficient and avoid MCP server startup overhead.

| Tool Need | CLI (Preferred) | MCP (When CLI Insufficient) |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------------|
| Screenshots & screen analysis | `peekaboo` CLI via Bash | N/A (removed) |
| Web research | WebSearch, WebFetch (built-in) | N/A |
| Library API docs | See web-research skill | context7 MCP (see web-research skill) |
| Interactive browser control | N/A | Playwright MCP |
| E2E testing | Playwright CLI (`npx playwright test`) | N/A |
| Slack communication | N/A | Slack MCP (no CLI substitute) |
| Confluence wiki | N/A | Confluence MCP (no CLI substitute) |

## Playwright MCP vs CLI

**Use Playwright MCP** (`mcp__playwright__*`) ONLY for:
- Interactive browser inspection (snapshots, clicking, form filling)
- Live debugging of web pages
- Visual verification requiring human-in-the-loop

**Use Playwright CLI** for:
- E2E test execution (`npx playwright test`)
- Test report generation
- CI/CD pipeline testing

## Playwright MCP Output Management

The `.playwright-mcp/` directory in the project root is gitignored. All Playwright MCP artifacts belong there.

- **Screenshots**: Use `.playwright-mcp/` prefix in the filename parameter (e.g., `.playwright-mcp/screenshot.png`). Without a filename, screenshots go to `.playwright-mcp/` automatically via `--output-dir`. With a filename, the path is resolved relative to cwd, so the prefix is required
- **Cleanup**: Delete `.playwright-mcp/` when Playwright MCP work is complete for the session
- **Never commit**: `.playwright-mcp/` is gitignored

## MCP Graceful Degradation

If an MCP server is unavailable, do not fail the workflow. Fall back to CLI alternatives or skip the MCP-dependent step with a note to the user.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Correct Approach |
|-------------|------------------|
| Using MCP when CLI exists | Use CLI — lower token cost, no server overhead |
| Adding MCP tools to agent frontmatter when CLI works | Use Bash tool with CLI commands |
| Proposing new MCP servers without CLI evaluation | Always check for CLI alternative first |
