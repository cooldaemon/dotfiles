# Verification Loop

## When to Use

- After completing a feature or significant code change
- Before creating a PR
- After refactoring

## Verification Principles

**Follow `makefile-first` skill for all command execution.**

### Build First
Check if the project builds. If build fails, STOP and fix before continuing.

### Type Safety
Run type checking. Zero type errors before proceeding.

### Lint Clean
Run linters. Zero errors required; review warnings.

### Tests Pass
Run test suite with coverage. All tests must pass. Coverage must meet project threshold.

### Security Scan
Run secrets detection and dependency vulnerability checks.

### Diff Review
Review `git diff` for:
- Unintended changes
- Missing error handling
- Potential edge cases
