# API Testing Patterns

## Core Principle

Every API endpoint must be validated across six dimensions: functional, security, performance, contract, error handling, and integration. Missing any dimension is a coverage gap.

## API Test Coverage Dimensions

| Dimension | What to Test | When to Flag Missing |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Functional | Request/response correctness, status codes, payload shape, field validation | Any new or modified endpoint without functional tests |
| Security | Authentication, authorization, input sanitization, abuse resistance | Any public-facing or auth-dependent endpoint without security tests |
| Performance | Response time SLAs, concurrency behavior, degradation under load | Any endpoint serving user-facing traffic without performance assertions |
| Contract | Schema compatibility, backward compatibility, consumer expectations | Any endpoint consumed by other services without contract tests |
| Error handling | Error response format, edge cases, failure modes | Any endpoint without negative test cases |
| Integration | Service-to-service communication, fallback behavior, timeout handling | Any endpoint calling external services without integration tests |

## Functional Testing

- Verify sensitive fields are never leaked in responses (passwords, internal IDs, tokens)
- Test pagination, filtering, and sorting parameters when applicable
- Test idempotency: calling the same mutation twice should not produce duplicate side effects

## Contract Testing

- Consumer-driven contracts: consumers define expectations, providers verify compliance
- Backward compatibility: adding fields is safe; removing or renaming fields breaks consumers
- Contract tests run in CI on every change to API response structures

### Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Correct Approach |
|--------------|------------------|
| Testing contracts only on the provider side | Consumer-driven: let consumers define what they need |
| Skipping contract tests for "internal" APIs | Internal APIs have consumers too -- they need contracts |
| Manual schema comparison | Automate schema validation in CI |

## API Security Testing (OWASP API Security Top 10)

Test every API against these vulnerability categories. This list is distinct from the general OWASP Top 10 covered by `security-patterns`.

| # | Vulnerability | What to Test |
|---|--------------|-------------|
| API1 | Broken Object Level Authorization | Access resource IDs belonging to other users; verify 403 |
| API2 | Broken Authentication | Token expiry, invalid tokens, missing tokens, brute force resistance |
| API3 | Broken Object Property Level Authorization | Attempt to read/write properties beyond the caller's permission scope |
| API4 | Unrestricted Resource Consumption | Rate limiting enforcement, payload size limits, query complexity limits |
| API5 | Broken Function Level Authorization | Call admin endpoints as regular user; verify 403 |
| API6 | Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows | Automate purchase/signup/voting flows; verify abuse controls exist |
| API7 | Server Side Request Forgery | Pass internal URLs in request fields; verify the server rejects or sanitizes |
| API8 | Security Misconfiguration | Verify CORS, HTTP headers, debug endpoints disabled, default credentials removed |
| API9 | Improper Inventory Management | Verify deprecated/shadow API versions return 404 or redirect |
| API10 | Unsafe Consumption of APIs | When the API calls third-party APIs, verify input from those APIs is validated |

### Security Test Principles

For general security testing patterns, see security-patterns skill. The following are API-testing-specific:

- Always test authentication bypass: requests without tokens must return 401
- Always test authorization escalation: requests for other users' resources must return 403
- Verify rate limiting returns 429 with Retry-After header under burst load
- Verify error responses do not leak stack traces, internal paths, or query details

## Performance Threshold Categories

Define thresholds per endpoint, not globally. Different endpoints have different SLA expectations.

| Category | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Response time (p95) | Define per endpoint based on SLA |
| Throughput | Test at multiples of normal traffic; verify no error rate increase |
| Error rate under load | Track 4xx and 5xx separately |
| Concurrent connections | Verify graceful degradation at pool exhaustion, not crashes |
| Payload size | Test with maximum expected payload; verify no timeout or memory issues |

## Error Handling and Edge Case Testing

Every API endpoint must have negative test cases covering:

| Category | Test Cases |
|----------|-----------|
| Malformed input | Invalid JSON, wrong content-type, truncated payloads |
| Missing required fields | Each required field omitted individually |
| Type violations | String where number expected, array where object expected |
| Boundary values | Empty strings, zero, negative numbers, max-length strings, Unicode, special characters |
| Duplicate operations | Creating the same resource twice (idempotency verification) |
| Concurrent modifications | Simultaneous updates to the same resource (conflict detection) |
| Timeout and cancellation | Slow upstream dependencies, client disconnect during processing |

## Integration Testing for Microservice Communication

| Pattern | What to Test |
|---------|-------------|
| Synchronous calls | Request/response between services, timeout handling, retry behavior |
| Asynchronous messaging | Message publishing, consumption, ordering, dead-letter handling |
| Circuit breaker | Verify circuit opens after failure threshold, half-open recovery, fallback responses |
| Service discovery | Verify correct routing when instances scale up/down |
| Distributed transactions | Saga completion, compensation on failure, idempotency of each step |

### Integration Test Principles

- Test with real service instances where feasible; use contract stubs for services you do not own
- Verify timeout and retry configuration: ensure retries use exponential backoff with jitter
- Test failure propagation: when a downstream service fails, verify the upstream returns an appropriate error (not 500 with a raw exception)
- Test data consistency: after a multi-service operation, verify all services have consistent state
- Isolate integration tests from unit/functional tests -- they have different reliability characteristics and execution times
