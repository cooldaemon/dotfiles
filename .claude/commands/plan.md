description: "Create implementation plan with EARS-format acceptance criteria using a subagent"
---

I'll use the planner subagent to create a comprehensive implementation plan.

The planner subagent will:
- Analyze requirements and break down into steps
- Define acceptance criteria in EARS format
- Identify architecture changes (automatically invokes architect if needed)
- Create testable criteria for TDD

## Prerequisites
- Clear understanding of the feature request
- Access to relevant codebase areas

## Next Commands
After planning:
- `/tdd` - Implement with test-driven development (uses EARS criteria from plan)
