description: "Capture and analyze screenshots using a specialized subagent"
---

I'll use the screenshot subagent to capture and analyze the requested screenshot.

The screenshot subagent will:
- Identify the target application or screen area
- Capture the screenshot using Peekaboo MCP
- Analyze the image locally (without external LLMs)
- Provide detailed visual analysis
- Save the image to an appropriate location

## Next Commands
After capturing screenshot:
- `/create-architecture-decision` - Document UI decisions
