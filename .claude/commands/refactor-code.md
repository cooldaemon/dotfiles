description: "Refactor code and remove dead code using subagents"
---

I'll use two subagents to improve code quality:

1. **refactor-cleaner** - Remove dead code, unused dependencies
2. **refactor** - Improve code quality, apply clean code principles

## Prerequisites
- All tests passing (green)
- Working implementation

## Next Commands
After refactoring:
- `/plan-done` - Delete the completed plan (if using /plan workflow)
- `/git-commit` - Commit the improvements
- `/update-claude-md` - Update project docs if needed
