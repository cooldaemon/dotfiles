---

I'll use the architect agent to create an Architecture Decision Record for your project.

The architect agent will:
- Check and create the docs/adr directory structure if needed
- Analyze the technical decision context
- Generate a new ADR file with proper numbering
- Update the index.md file automatically
- Follow the standard ADR template from adr-patterns skill

## Prerequisites
- Clear understanding of the problem
- Options considered
- Decision rationale
