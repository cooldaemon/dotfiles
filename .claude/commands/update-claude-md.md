description: "Update project's CLAUDE.md with session insights using a subagent"
---

I'll use the update-claude-md subagent to update the project's CLAUDE.md file with important insights from our session.

The update-claude-md subagent will:
- Extract key learnings and conventions from our session
- Check for existing CLAUDE.md file
- Update or create the file with organized sections
- Preserve existing valuable information
- Ensure the documentation remains current and useful

## Prerequisites
- Changes that affect project understanding
- New conventions or patterns established

## Next Commands
After updating documentation:
- `/git-commit` - Commit the documentation updates
- `/git-rebase-push` - Share with the team
