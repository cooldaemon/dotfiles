description: "Refactor code according to general coding standards and project-specific CLAUDE.md using a subagent"

I'll use the refactor subagent to improve the code quality of the specified files.

The refactor subagent will:
- Check for project-specific CLAUDE.md standards
- Analyze code for improvement opportunities
- Apply clean code principles and tidyings
- Run verification tests to ensure functionality
- Maintain backward compatibility
