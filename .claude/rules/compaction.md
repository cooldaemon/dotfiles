# Compaction Preservation

When compacting conversation, always preserve:

1. **Current Task**: What we are working on right now
2. **Next Steps**: Immediate actions to take after compaction
3. **Modified Files**: Full paths with line numbers of recently changed files
4. **Key Decisions**: Important choices made and their rationale
5. **Blockers/Issues**: Any unresolved problems or errors
6. **Test Commands**: Commands used to verify changes
